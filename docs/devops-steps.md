# Step 1: buy a domain name from a provider (namesilo is recommended)

For example, lets say I bought 'my-domain.com' on namesilo, and if you run 'whois my-domain.com', you will see the name servers as 'NS1.DNSOWL.COM', 'NS2.DNSOWL.COM' and 'NS3.DNSOWL.COM'. Our next step would need to change that name servers to ours on linode.


# Step 2: create domain on linode
### Go to: https://cloud.linode.com/domains/create and fill out the creation form (omit the input for inser default records)
